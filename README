The Real Costs is a Firefox plug-in that inserts emissions data into travel related e-commerce websites.

Current State:

This plugin is being rebuilt for the latest version of Firefox.

History:

This project was created in 2006 by Michael Mandiberg. It was commissioned by Rhizome.
The Real Costs is a greasmonkey script compiled to xpi, and it stopped working with Firefox 2.0.0.3
We are currently in the process of rebuilding it to make it functional again.
